(what do you say?) \n\nWill the human race be run in a day? (in a day?) \n\nOr will someone save this planet we're playing on? \n\nIs it the only one? \n\n\n\nWhat are we gonna do? \n\n\n\nHelp them to see (help them to see) \n\nThat the people here are like you and me. (like you and me) \n\nLet us show them how to play (how to play) \n\nThe pipes of peace, (pipes of peace) \n\nPlay the pipes of peace. \n\n\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh. \n\n\n\nI light a candle to our love, \n\nIn love our problems disappear. \n\nBut all in all we soon discover \n\nThat one and one is all we long to hear."
